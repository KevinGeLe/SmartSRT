# SmartSRT
SmartSRT is my attempt, at an community run end-to-end solution for automatically generating subtitles for videos with a maximum subtitle length constraint, along with speaker diarization. It uses machine learning models for speech recognition, text summarization, face regocnition, and diarization, and can be run on a CUDA GPU for faster performance.


# TODO:
🔴 Add Face recognition (±1 second)
🔴 Add Max-Subtitle-Lenght with Per-Word-Timestamps.
🔴 Add new parsers for Max-Lenght, Output, Input and Model
✔️ Refactor code to improve readability
🔴 Work on improving performance
🔴 Update README.md
